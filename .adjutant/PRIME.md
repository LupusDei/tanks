# Adjutant Agent Protocol

## MCP Communication (MANDATORY)

You have MCP tools for communicating with the Adjutant dashboard and other agents.
These tools are connected via `.mcp.json` at the project root. **Always use MCP tools
for communication — never rely on stdout or text output alone.**

### Responding to Messages

When you receive a message (from the user or another agent), you **MUST** respond
using `send_message`, NOT by printing to stdout. The dashboard and iOS app only see
MCP messages.

- **On startup**: Call `read_messages({ limit: 5 })` to check for pending messages
- **During work**: Periodically check for new messages
- **For general replies**: Use `send_message({ to: "user", body: "..." })`

### Filing Questions and Blocking Actions (MANDATORY)

**`file_question` is the MANDATORY front door for anything you need from the General.**
This covers two categories — both MUST go through the queue:

1. **Questions / decisions**: anything you need the General to answer, clarify, or decide.
2. **Blocking actions** (`action_required`): tasks only the General can complete — provide
   a key or secret, grant access, approve a step, make a call. Signal these with
   `category: "action_required"`.

```
// Question or decision
file_question({
  body: "Should the retry limit be 3 or 5?",
  context: "Implementing the push-notification retry path (adj-013.3.1). A limit of 3 \
matches existing patterns but Apple recommends 5 for high-urgency tokens.",
  urgency: "normal",
  suggestedOptions: ["3 retries", "5 retries"]
})

// User-blocking action (the General must DO something, not just answer)
file_question({
  body: "Need the APNS production certificate to unblock push notifications",
  context: "adj-013.3.1 is complete except for the prod cert. Dev cert works in sandbox. \
Blocking on the production .p12 file to proceed.",
  urgency: "blocking",
  category: "action_required"
})
```

**Guardrails — do NOT:**
- Do NOT bury questions or blocking actions in `send_message` — they disappear into chat and
  miss the triage queue
- Do NOT use `AskUserQuestion` — it halts execution and the General may not be at the terminal
- Do NOT block on stdin waiting for an answer

**After filing**: call `set_status({ status: "blocked", task: "Waiting for: <question summary>" })`,
state your assumption, and continue on unblocked work.

`send_message` stays for general comms and replying to the General — not for questions.

### Sending Messages

```
send_message({ to: "user", body: "Build complete. All tests pass." })
send_message({ to: "user", body: "Finished adj-013.2, moving to adj-013.3" })
```

### Status Reporting

Report state changes so the dashboard shows your current activity:

```
set_status({ status: "working", task: "Implementing feature X", beadId: "adj-013.2.1" })
set_status({ status: "blocked", task: "Waiting for API key" })
set_status({ status: "done" })
```

### Progress on Long Tasks

```
report_progress({ task: "adj-013.2", percentage: 50, description: "Halfway done" })
```

### Announcements

For events that need dashboard attention:

```
announce({ type: "completion", title: "Feature done", body: "All tests pass.", beadId: "adj-013.2" })
announce({ type: "blocker", title: "Need help", body: "Can't access the API", beadId: "adj-013.2" })
```

## Bead Tracking

Use beads (`bd` CLI) for ALL task tracking. Do NOT use TaskCreate, TaskUpdate, or markdown files.

```bash
bd update <id> --status=in_progress   # Before starting work
bd close <id>                          # After completing work
bd vc commit -m "session end"          # Before shutting down (if using Dolt backend)
```
