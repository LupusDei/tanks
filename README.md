# Scorched Earth Tanks

A modern remake of the classic turn-based artillery game **Scorched Earth**, built as a single-page web application using React and TypeScript.

## Game Overview

Scorched Earth Tanks is a two-player turn-based strategy game where players control tanks positioned on opposite sides of a randomly generated terrain. Players take turns adjusting their tank's cannon angle and power settings to fire projectiles at their opponent. The first player to destroy the enemy tank wins.

### Core Gameplay Mechanics

1. **Loading Screen**: The game starts with delightful animations that play for a few seconds before revealing a Start button
2. **Terrain Generation**: Random procedural terrain is generated at the start of each match
3. **Tank Placement**: Two tanks are placed on opposite sides (left/right) of the terrain, each with a distinct color
4. **Turn-Based Combat**: Players alternate turns to fire at each other
5. **Aiming System**: Players select:
   - **Angle**: 0-90 degrees for cannon direction
   - **Power**: 0-100% for shot velocity
6. **Physics Simulation**: Projectiles follow realistic ballistic trajectories using gravity (10 m/s²)
7. **Projectile Tracing**: A dotted line shows the path of the projectile as it flies
8. **Collision Detection**:
   - Projectile impacts create small explosion animations
   - If explosion overlaps any part of enemy tank, that tank is destroyed
   - Player who made the hit wins
9. **Win Condition**: Game ends when one tank is destroyed

### Physics Calibration

- Gravitational constant: **10 m/s²**
- Screen calibration: Full power (100%) at 70° angle sends projectile from far left to far right of screen
- Physics scale dynamically to canvas dimensions

### Folder Organization

- **`src/components/`**: React components for UI elements (buttons, controls, canvas, screens)
- **`src/engine/`**: Core game logic, physics calculations, collision detection, game state
- **`src/utils/`**: Shared utilities, constants, helper functions, type definitions

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:LupusDei/tanks.git
cd tanks

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173/`

### Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server with hot reload
npm run build    # Build for production (TypeScript compile + Vite build)
npm run preview  # Preview production build locally
npm run lint     # Run ESLint to check code quality
npm test         # Run test suite
npm test -- --watch    # Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --coverage # Run tests with coverage report
```

## Testing Strategy

**Tests are MANDATORY** - Every feature must have corresponding tests.

### Testing Framework
- **Vitest**: Fast unit testing framework (Vite-native)
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing
- **Coverage Target**: >80% for critical code paths

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Watch mode (auto-rerun on changes)
npm test -- --watch

# Coverage report
npm test -- --coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test physics.test.ts
```

### Test Organization

Tests live alongside the code they test:

```
src/
├── engine/
│   ├── physics.ts
│   ├── physics.test.ts        # Unit tests for physics
│   ├── collision.ts
│   └── collision.test.ts
├── components/
│   ├── Canvas.tsx
│   └── Canvas.test.tsx        # Component tests
└── utils/
    ├── math.ts
    └── math.test.ts
```

### Testing Requirements

- ✅ Write tests BEFORE or ALONGSIDE implementation
- ✅ Test edge cases and error conditions
- ✅ Keep tests fast and independent
- ✅ Use descriptive test names
- ✅ Mock external dependencies
- ❌ Never commit code without tests
- ❌ Never skip failing tests

### Example Test Structure

```typescript
// physics.test.ts
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest'
import { calculateTrajectory } from './physics'

describe('calculateTrajectory', () => {
  it('should calculate correct position at t=0', () => {
    const result = calculateTrajectory(45, 100, 0)
    expect(result).toEqual({ x: 0, y: 0 })
  })

  it('should account for gravity over time', () => {
    const result = calculateTrajectory(45, 100, 1)
    expect(result.y).toBeLessThan(0) // Falling due to gravity
  })
})
```

## Code Quality & Modularity

### Modularity Principles

This project is designed for **parallel development**. Multiple agents must be able to work simultaneously without conflicts.

**Key Principles:**
- ✅ **One responsibility per module**: Each file has a single, clear purpose
- ✅ **Clear interfaces**: Modules communicate through well-defined APIs
- ✅ **Minimal coupling**: Changes in one module shouldn't break others
- ✅ **Independent testing**: Each module can be tested in isolation
- ✅ **No circular dependencies**: Keep dependency graph acyclic

### Module Boundaries

```
src/engine/          → Pure game logic (no React dependencies)
src/components/      → React UI (no direct game logic)
src/utils/           → Shared utilities (no dependencies on engine or components)
```

**Example of Good Modularity:**
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Clear interface, no coupling
// engine/physics.ts
export function calculateTrajectory(angle: number, power: number, time: number): Position {
  // Pure calculation, no side effects
}

// components/Canvas.tsx
import { calculateTrajectory } from '../engine/physics'
// Uses physics as a dependency, but physics doesn't know about Canvas
```

**Example of Poor Modularity:**
```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Tight coupling
// engine/physics.ts
import { Canvas } from '../components/Canvas'  // Engine shouldn't import components!
```

### Clean Code Standards

- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: No `any` types, proper type definitions
- **Descriptive Names**: `calculateProjectileVelocity()` not `calc()`
- **Small Functions**: <50 lines, single responsibility
- **DRY Principle**: Extract common logic into utilities
- **Error Handling**: Handle edge cases gracefully
- **Comments**: Only when necessary - prefer self-documenting code

### Quality Gates

Before committing, ALL of these must pass:

```bash
npm run build     # TypeScript compilation
npm run lint      # Code style and quality
npm test          # Test suite
```

If any fail, fix them before committing.

## Issue Tracking with Beads

This project uses **beads** (`bd` CLI) for issue tracking. All work items are tracked as issues with dependencies.

### Key Commands

```bash
bd ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)
bd list               # List all issues
bd show <id>          # View detailed issue information
bd update <id> --status=in_progress   # Claim a task
bd close <id>         # Mark task complete
bd stats              # Project statistics
```

### Branching Workflow

🚨 **STOP - READ BEFORE CODING** 🚨

**ALL work MUST be done on feature branches**. Each issue gets its own branch named after the issue ID.

**⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
1. **NEVER work directly on master** - Always create a feature branch first
2. **Every change needs a bead** - Create issue first using `bd create`
3. **Write tests** - No code without tests
4. **Run quality gates** - Build + lint + test must ALL pass

#### Standard Workflow

```bash
# 1. Find and claim work (or create new issue if needed)
bd ready
bd update <issue-id> --status=in_progress

# 2. Create feature branch from master
git checkout master && git pull
git checkout -b <issue-id>

# 3. Implement the feature
# ... make changes, write tests ...

# 4. Verify ALL quality gates pass
npm run build && npm run lint && npm test

# 5. Commit to feature branch
git add <files>
git commit -m "Description

Closes <issue-id>

Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"

# 6. Push feature branch to remote
git push -u origin <issue-id>

# 7. Merge to master
git checkout master
git pull
git merge <issue-id>
git push

# 8. Clean up (keep remote branch for history)
git branch -d <issue-id>
# Do NOT delete remote branch - keep for reference
bd close <issue-id>
bd sync
```

**Note:** Remote feature branches are preserved for historical reference and traceability.

### Critical Workflow Rules

⚠️ **EVERY change MUST be tied to a bead** - Create an issue first if one doesn't exist
⚠️ **NEVER work directly on master** - Always use feature branches
⚠️ **NEVER commit without tests** - Add/update tests for every change
⚠️ **NEVER skip quality gates** - Build, lint, and test must ALL pass
⚠️ **Work is NOT complete until pushed to master** - Push branch, merge, push master
⚠️ **Clean up local branches only** - Delete local branch, keep remote for history

**Traceability:** Every commit must reference its beads issue ID (e.g., "Closes tanks-xyz") to maintain complete project history and enable proper tracking.

See `AGENTS.md` for complete detailed workflow instructions with examples.
